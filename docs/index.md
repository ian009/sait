The SAIT Flow Lab in KA1123 consists of [four flow runs](indexes/index_devices.md)

+ [Run 1](flow_runs/run_1.md)

+ [Run 2](flow_runs/run_2.md)

+ [Run 3](flow_runs/run_3.md)

+ [Run 4](flow_runs/run_4.md)


[Fieldcare](fieldcare/fieldcare.md) is installed on each flow run workstation & can be used to communicate with the [devices](indexes/index_devices.md) using one of the following protocols


* [HART](indexes/index_devices_hart.md)
* [Profibus](indexes/index_devices_profibus.md)
* [Foundation Fieldbus](indexes/index_devices_ff.md)
* [Ethernet I/P](indexes/index_devices_ip.md)

There are a few [non-SMART devices](indexes/index_devices_non_smart.md) that are not capable of digital communication.
